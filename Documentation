Introduction
ReactOS is an open-source operating system designed to be binary-compatible with Microsoft Windows NT family (Windows NT4, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 7). The goal of ReactOS is to allow users to run Windows applications and drivers natively, without requiring a copy of Microsoft Windows. ReactOS is developed from scratch, using clean-room reverse engineering, and is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

ReactOS aims to provide a free, open, and stable alternative to Windows for users who want Windows compatibility without proprietary software restrictions.

Tech Stack
ReactOS is primarily written in C and C++. Its development relies on several open-source tools and technologies:

Programming Languages: C, C++

Build System: CMake, Ninja, GNU Make

Compiler: GCC (MinGW), MSVC (Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler)

Debugger: WinDbg, GDB

Version Control: Git (hosted on GitHub)

Testing Frameworks: Web Test Manager, Unit tests for API compatibility

Virtualization for Testing: VirtualBox, QEMU, VMware

ReactOS uses a modular architecture similar to Windows NT, consisting of kernel mode, user mode, subsystems, and drivers.

Page 2: Implementation of ReactOS and Features
Implementation of ReactOS
ReactOS follows the Windows NT architecture model and includes the following major components:

Kernel: The core that manages hardware, memory, and processes.

Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL): Interfaces between the kernel and physical hardware.

Executive: Provides essential services such as I/O management, security, and process management.

Win32 Subsystem: Implements Windows API calls and user interface components.

File Systems: Supports FAT, NTFS, and others for file storage and management.

Drivers: Compatible with Windows drivers to support hardware devices.

User Interface: Explorer shell similar to Windows Explorer.

ReactOS development involves writing and reverse engineering these components to behave as closely as possible to Windows NT systems.

Key Features of ReactOS
Windows Compatibility: Ability to run Windows applications and drivers.

Open Source: Licensed under GPL, allowing anyone to use, modify, and distribute.

Lightweight: Uses fewer system resources than Windows.

Modular Architecture: Mimics Windows NTâ€™s layered structure.

Networking Support: TCP/IP stack compatible with Windows.

File System Support: Supports FAT, NTFS, and other Windows file systems.

Active Community: Regular updates and active developer support.

Page 3: Common Issues and How to Resolve Them
Common Issues in ReactOS
System Instability and Crashes

ReactOS is in alpha stage and can experience frequent crashes.

Often caused by incomplete driver support or unimplemented system calls.

Application Compatibility

Some Windows applications may not run or behave incorrectly.

Due to missing or incomplete API implementations.

Hardware Support Limitations

Limited device driver availability compared to Windows.

Certain hardware (e.g., GPUs, network cards) may not function fully.

Build Failures

Developers may encounter errors while compiling source code.

Can be due to environment misconfiguration or missing dependencies.

How to Resolve Common Issues
Issue	Resolution
System Instability	Test with virtual machines to isolate hardware issues, check logs, and report bugs with details.
Application Compatibility	Check JIRA/GitHub for existing compatibility fixes, contribute by testing and reporting issues.
Hardware Support	Use supported hardware, contribute to driver development, or use virtualization for unsupported devices.
Build Failures	Follow official build instructions carefully, set up the recommended environment, and consult community forums.

Reporting Bugs and Seeking Help
Use the ReactOS JIRA or GitHub Issues to report bugs:
https://jira.reactos.org
https://github.com/reactos/reactos/issues

Provide detailed reproduction steps, logs, screenshots, and environment details.

Engage with the community via mailing lists, forums, or IRC channels for support.
